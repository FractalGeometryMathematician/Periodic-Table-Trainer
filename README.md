This program makes up a game that allows the user to train themselves on various periodic elements and their initials. I made this initially at the beginning of the year on Repl.it as an aid to myself and my classmates to learn and memorize the chemical elements for our chemistry class. I haphazardly placed it in a repository at about that time, but it was imporperly done and viewers couldnt see or download it.
